# FFVI
image fusion algorithm for visible and infrared images


# NOTE
1. There is a test demo.m in the folder, you can run it to see the effect.

2. It must be noted that m1 must be a visible image and m2 is an infrared image, otherwise the fusion will fail.

3. This algorithm only fuses single-channel images, so if it is a multi-channel image, such as a color image (RGB), it must be "ffvi fusion" for a single channel and then superimposed.
